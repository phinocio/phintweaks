# Installation 

## Ultimate Skyrim

- Load `ToggleableAetheriumHelmetNightVision - Ultimate Skyrim.esp` after `UltimateSkyrim.esp`, re-run reqtificator.

## Requiem

Tested with v3.0.2 and v3.4

# Compatibility

- Incompatible with any mod that changes the Aetherium Helmet armor record or its Object Effect record as my mod would overwrite (or be overwritten) by those changes. (Let me know what mod and I can probably make a patch for it.) 


# Known Issues

- If using iEquip, I've come across an issue where it breaks the `DLC2defaultAddSpellOnEquipScript` script and this change will not work (also affects Ancano's Gloves in my testing).
