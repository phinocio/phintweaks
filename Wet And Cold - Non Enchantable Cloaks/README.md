# Wet And Cold - Non Enchantable Cloaks
> Current Version: **v1.0.0**

The Complete Crafting Reqtified mod changes Cloaks of Skyrim and Winter Is Coming Cloaks cloaks to be non-enchantable. This makes Wet and Cold cloaks in line with that. Simply adds MagicDisallowEnchanting [KYWD:000C27BD] keyword to the cloaks.

# Installation

## Ultimate Skyrim & Requiem

- Load after `Wet And Cold esp`. Left side doesn't matter.

# Compatibility

- Incompatible with any other mod that affects the Cloaks records from Wet & Cold as it would overwrite (or be overwritten) by that. (Let me know what mod and I can probably make a patch for it.)

# Known Issues

- None.
