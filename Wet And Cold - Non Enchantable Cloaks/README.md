# Wet And Cold - Non Enchantable Cloaks
> Current Version: **v1.0.0**

Made with Ultimate Skyrim in mind. Can be used with Requiem no problem (technically only requires W&C). Simply adds keyword to the cloaks making them unenchantable. Requires W&C.

# Installation

## Ultimate Skyrim & Requiem

- Load after `Wet And Cold esp`. Left side doesn't matter.

# Compatibility

- Incompatible with any other mod that affects the Cloaks records from Wet & Cold as it would overwrite (or be overwritten) by that. (Let me know what mod and I can probably make a patch for it.)

# Known Issues

- None.
