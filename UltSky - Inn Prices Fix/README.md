# Installation 

## Ultimate Skyrim

- MO2 left side order doesn't matter.
- Load `UltSky - Inn Price Fix.esp` after `UltimateSkyrim.esp`
- In the Inns and Taverns MCM, change the default room cost to 10

## Requiem - not supported

- Not meant for Requiem alone, use at your own risk. Literally only changes the `RoomCost` global value to 10 and removes the `Constant` flag.

# Compatibility

- Only intended for UltSky v4.0.7

# Known Issues

- None.
