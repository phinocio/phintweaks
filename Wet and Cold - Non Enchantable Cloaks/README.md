# Wet and Cold - Non Enchantable Cloaks
> Current Version: **v1.0.1**

The Complete Crafting Reqtified mod changes `Cloaks of Skyrim` and `Winter Is Coming - Cloaks` cloaks to be non-enchantable. This makes `Wet and Cold` cloaks in line with that. Simply adds `MagicDisallowEnchanting [KYWD:000C27BD]` keyword to the cloaks.
